	<p>Nearly all European nations are experiencing long-term downtrends in fertility, and consequently, ageing of their populations. These demographic trends could have potentially damaging consequences for European economies. Concern over these trends has sparked intense debate over the most effective policies to reverse them or mitigate their consequences. Three broad policy approaches have been considered: (1) encourage childbearing (marriage and cohabitation) among younger couples; (2) increase immigration of working-age people; and (3) reform social policy more generally, in order to ameliorate the negative consequences of these trends.</p>

	<h2>ONE WAY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MAKE MO BABIES</h2>
	<p>GOOD OR BAD?</p>
	<p>Denmark has one of the lowest birthrates in all of Europe, with only 1.7 children per family. That might not sound like a huge deal, but it has huge implications. Because so few new children are being born, the Danish government has to decide whether or not to keep many of its public services open. What good is a school if there are no children to fill it?</p>
